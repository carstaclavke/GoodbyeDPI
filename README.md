# Gta 5 Lowrider Dlc
 
 
Lowrider is an American automobile magazine, focusing on the style known as a lowrider. It first appeared in 1977, produced out of San Jose, California, by a trio of San Jose college students. In its 46th Year of existence, Lowrider Magazine celebrates artistry, cars, culture, and unity.
 
A **lowrider** or **low rider** is a customized car with a lowered body that emerged among Mexican American youth in the 1940s.[3] *Lowrider* also refers to the driver of the car and their participation in lowrider car clubs, which remain a part of Chicano culture and have since expanded internationally.[3][4] These customized vehicles are also artworks, generally being painted with intricate, colorful designs, unique aesthetic features, and rolling on wire-spoke wheels with whitewall tires.[3][5]

Lowrider car culture began in Los Angeles, California, in the mid-to-late 1940s, and grew during the post-war prosperity of the 1950s within Mexican-American youth culture. Conversion of standard production vehicles included adding lowering blocks and cut-down spindles, reduced-length suspension spring coils, and creating "Z frames" from stock straight frames.[*citation needed*] The purpose of lowriders, as their motto "Low and Slow" suggests, is to cruise as slowly and as smoothly as possible.[9]
 
Section 24008 of the California Vehicle Code went into effect on January 1, 1958, prohibiting cars modified to shift the vehicle body lower than the bottoms of its wheel rims. In 1959, mechanic Ron Aguirre bypassed the law by installing hydraulics that could quickly toggle the height of a General Motors X-frame chassis.[11]
 
Lowriding became widely popular in the 1980s and 1990s, and bans were enacted in many California cities.[12] It regained popularity a little in 2009, then significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[13] In the 2020s, activists argued that the practice was harmless and banning it was simply the result of prejudice against Mexican-Americans.[5] San Jose and Sacramento repealed their bans in 2022 that had been enacted in 1986 and 1988, respectively.[10][12] In 2022, the California State Assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging all remaining cities with bans (including National City, which banned it in 1992) to repeal them.[14] In 2023, California rescinded state restrictions on the height of vehicle bodies and superseded local regulations against cruising.[8]
 
In 1959, a customizer named Ron Aguirre developed a way of bypassing the law with the use of hydraulic Pesco pumps and valves that allowed him to change ride height at the flick of a switch.[16] Ron Aguirre developed this modification with help from his father, after conceiving of the idea. Aguirre's motivation was to stop being targeted with traffic tickets, as he had been by local police in his city of Rialto, California after the statewide ban was enacted.[7]
 
1958 saw the emergence of the Chevrolet Impala, which featured an X-shaped frame that was perfectly suited for lowering and modification with hydraulics.[16] The standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated "X." Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between conventional perimeter frame construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis, the body structure was strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall. This frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side impact crash, as a conventional perimeter frame.[17]

Lowrider cars had their origins in the 1940s, when Mexican American veterans began customizing vehicles to run "low and slow", a contrast to the hot rod that was customized for speed. During the Chicano Movement in the 1970s, lowriders formed car clubs that began to help their community by using these cars for fundraising.[18] Lowrider cars are typically elaborately painted and decorated, often using graphic art of significance to Chicano culture.[18][5]
 
In Albuquerque, cruising on Central Avenue (U.S. Route 66) has become a tradition, particularly on Sundays. The city and Albuquerque Police Department (APD) used to take a firm stance against this practice,[25] but in recent years have reversed this stance, with APD introducing a lowrider police car[26] and the city creating a 'Cruising Task Force' to "promote responsible cruising" in the city.[27]
 
Junichi Shimodaira continues to import and sell these cars through his business, Paradise Road.[31] The spread of lowrider culture and the fame of Paradise Road even attracted the attention of Ed Roth, who is famous for creating custom cars such as hot rods and a prominent figure in Kustom Kulture.[32] Since the introduction of lowriders in Japan and the rise of lowriders in Japan in 2001, it is estimated that there are still 200 car clubs that are related to the lowrider scene that are still active to this day.[33]
 
In the 1990s, low riders became strongly associated with West Coast Hip hop and G-Funk culture. Eazy-E, Mack 10, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, The Game, Warren G, South Central Cartel, Above the Law and John Cena (In a music video of "Right Now") among others featured low riders prominently in their music videos.[35]
 
Born from a creative collaboration between Neven Eyewear and Tim Howley of the brand Tombstone Hardware and metal band Fit For An Autopsy, the Lowrider sunglasses embody Tim's rugged spirit and passion for vintage motorcycles. Inspired by the laidback LA lowrider culture and Harley Davidson's classic Lowrider bikes, these shades fuse rebellious edge with retro Americana vibes.
 
The sleek TR90 frames in an all black colorway evoke the aerodynamic profiles of customized vintage hot rods, while signature coffin icons on the lenses nod to Tim's brand Tombstone Hardware and add gothic flair. The dark shades pay homage to Tim's love of iconic chopper motorcycles. Whether cruising the Pacific Coast Highway or exploring Route 66, the Lowriders channel a rugged wanderlust spirit.
 
Combining Tim Howley's metal edge with Neven's refined coastal style, the all-black Lowriders are a modern icon with vintage rebel vibes. Slip on these handcrafted shades to embrace the free roadways of America's past.
 
Whatever my router last assigns to the pi, I toss it on, I use baud rate 921600, toss that in additional baud rates in octoprint if you like. You can also connect directly to the ESP01-S, but it wants gcode filenames in 8.3 format, which can be annoying.
 
The SKR 1.2 was great, but I wanted the option to do unusual upgrades in the future and used this opportunity to try out an Octopus v1.1 controller. Octopus was more work to setup. The SKR 1.2 is better documented, tested and understood on this forum.
 
Since I liked the ESP3D experience I ended up setting up ESP32 module compatible with Octopus.
This was meant to be temporary, because the plan is to eventually end up with V1PI or Octoprint, and try Klipper. Lots of sender/controller options out there that people like/dislike for various reasons.
 
My MP3DP v4 Octopus is directly connected to a Pi running Klipper. Am starting to like the MainSail/Klipper Web-UI experience, but expect to keep running ESP3D-Marlin on my LR3, am living with that setup for now.
 
This is pretty much what i do for all my boards still running marlin, which is only 1 printer and my lowrider 3, but rather than run octoprint from a pi, I run it from a kubernetes cluster in my main server rack.
 
These materials reflect important qualities of the lowrider movement: creativity, independence, cultural pride, resistance, activism, community service, collectivism, tradition and ritual, and cultural continuity.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LOW RIDER")WAR: (Singing) Take a little trip. Take a little trip. Take a little trip with me.A MARTNEZ, BYLINE: Let's take that trip to Southern California in the '70s and '80s, when, as a kid, I would go with my uncles to places in L.A. where lowriders cruised the boulevards. Beautifully painted classic cars, basically rolling art installations with chrome rims and whitewall tires. From Cadillac Eldorados to Chevy Impalas, all riding low and slow, hugging the pavement set on hydraulics to let the driver raise it instantly by literally flipping a switch.(SOUNDBITE OF HYDRAULICS PUMPING)MARTNEZ: I remember asking a lowrider owner why it did that. First, his head recoiled. Then his face leaned forward in the mind and he said in an annoyed, sarcastic tone that I'll never forget - so the cops don't give me a ticket. I learned two things after that exchange - one, don't ask that guy any more questions, and two, that in 1958, the California Vehicle Code banned modifying cars so the frame is lower than the bottom of the wheel rim. By putting them on hydraulics, they'd be lowriders one second and then street-legal vehicles the next. California only last year ended a restriction that many felt targeted Mexican Americans. We went to the city of San Fernando to talk to some lowrider enthusiasts. Here's Fernando Perez - or Birdman - Elbert Morales and Cesar Ibarra.FERNANDO PEREZ: It's, like, how I am, how we are, the way I dress, the way I walk, the way I talk, the way I look, the way my car is.ELBERT MORALES: I recommend it for the younger kids, get into lowrider bikes and get the tradition going.CESAR IBARRA: It's a family thing. We go out cruising with the family. It's not a hobby for me, it's my lifestyle. I grew up into this, you know, it's. - and it's something that I always followed. My youngest daughter loves it. You know, she's also looking for a car to follow her dad's footsteps. Yeah.MARTNEZ: To learn more about how this lowrider culture spans generations, we called up Denise Sandoval. She's a professor of Chicana and Chicano studies at Cal State, Northridge.DENISE SANDOVAL: It's not just involving the craftsmanship of these fantastic cars. Lowriding is something that's part of people's everyday lives where they just cruise to have fun, hang out in the park. Oftentimes in Chicano communities, people use lowriders instead of limousines for quinceaneras and weddings. Lowriders talk about it being a way of life, and it's larger than just the style of the car.MARTNEZ: How are younger people adapting - if they are - to lowrider culture?SANDOVAL: I see the culture, like, at the shows and on the streets as being multigenerational. Lowriders, they talk about it as, like, we're a lowrider family, creating space for the family to celebrate community, to celebrate the culture. And some people even say, you know, pride of being, like, Chicano. But classic cars are really expensive to buy now. These old cars can be, like, $30,000 and up.MARTNEZ: Things are getting expensive in all kinds of ways. But when you got a generation of teenagers or even young adults who are trying to figure out a way to pay for college or for their student loans, or in California, find a place to live that doesn't break the bank, I would think that it might be hard to pass on this lowrider culture when it is kind of such an expensive hobby now to have.SANDOVAL: Yeah. And I think on the other hand, I think is there's a lot of younger men and even women that are getting into the custom work of whether it be, like, painting or hydraulics. You also need to pass down the knowledge to a younger generation of craftsmen that can do that work, as well. So you see it with lowrider bicycle clubs where you see a lot of, like, young boys and even girls that are learning to sort of - the appreciation for customizing their bicycle and the teamwork. So there are aspects in the culture right now that integrate sort of the children and the younger generation into the culture.MARTNEZ: If someone were to just quickly look, you know, for a video or pictures of lowriders, you usually see men around these lowriders. But women play a huge role, and have for a long time, in lowrider culture.SANDOVAL: I think what we've seen in, like, the last, like, six, seven years is, like, a lot more women-only car clubs. And, like, some of them got their lowrider from their mom, like, their mom was a solo rider back in the day. And that's pretty cool. So...MARTNEZ: Yeah.SANDOVAL: ...I think today, women are stepping out. Some car clubs that were exclusively just for men are becoming coed. So there's a lot of changing in the, like, gender politics. They were like, we're not going to wait to be invited into these car clubs.MARTNEZ: Yeah.SANDOVAL: We're just going to create our own.MARTNEZ: Even though it started in California and grew around the Southwest of the United States, it has now exploded all over the world. Japan has a thriving lowrider culture, and that's just one spot.SANDOVAL: Yeah. Lowriding definitely is global. You know, Japan has been part of the community since the '90s. And then also in, like, places like Brazil and, like, Spain and, like, Paris and Belgium, they're using their cars to express themselves, to build community and be part of this larger lowrider movement.MARTNEZ: Aside from keeping something beautiful going - because the cars are beautiful - why is it important for lowrider culture to continue to grow, thrive and exist?SANDOVAL: I think that culture is the one way that communities, particularly working-class communities, historically have created space for themselves to not just express how they want to portray their culture, but to also participate in what we call, like, American popular culture. And I see a lot of similarities with, like, lowriding and hip-hop. How these cultures emerged out of communities that were experiencing, like, segregation, racism. When you see how culture was used in the Civil Rights Movements of the '60s and the '70s, like, the music, the art - right? - it's sort of foundational to empowering us to think about not only how we should take pride in our culture, but demand equality. So I think it really speaks to the dynamic way that cultural expressions, whether it be music or cars, allow people a way to not just exist but survive and also thrive.MARTNEZ: That's Denise Sandoval, a professor of Chicana and Chicano studies at Cal State University, Northridge. Denise, thanks.SANDOVAL: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LOWRIDER")CYPRESS HILL: (Rapping) Coming through for real, we're Cypress Hill. Oh, baby. Got that crunk for your trunk...
